How to call a api in react ? 1:17
1. Api should not written with the component because it will rerender everytime when a state change
-> loads -> api (300 ms) -> render (500 ms)
-> loads -> render (200 ms) -> api (300 ms) -> update ui (500 ms)
api calls should be written inside use effect
useEffect uses
use effect is hook is function have 2 param 1 is call back and other dependency array 
it call every time thus we use dependency array to call use effect
to use it once -> pass empty dependency array
to use it based on state variable > pass state variable in the dependency array
