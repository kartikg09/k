after installing a package we need to configure the package
folder name in smaller case
file name in capitalcase for file having default components
file name in smallcase for file having named components
constants variables in capital case
import * as obj --> here obj is a js object, destructuring and all the exported properties can be used.
in a file there are two type of export - default, or named


one way data binding  - react
modify variable to make input work.

whe can use events to change the function
like - onChange event -  it expect a callback function
there is e (event) inside  the events triggering props calback function which contain the value of the function
changing text inside the input component changes react will rerender that component
local variable are not preferred inside react suppose you have to change that variable
every component in react maintains a state.
u can put some variable in the state 
every time u have to create a local variable u use state inside react. for eg. : useState hook

imp point regarding hook chapter 5 time 00:55

what is state?
what is hooks?
hooks are just normal function.
every hook have specific function for it.
what is use state?
to create state variable
to use import it like named variable
this function returns a array first value of this array is variable name and provide a default value by providing inside the argument
to modify the state variable we need to use the function as per react  
react use state hook return a array, where 0 idx - variable, 1 idx - modification  function
event object - default in event emitters - to access valof fields -  event.target.value
1:25 equivalent variable javascript and jsx
synthetic events
two way binding --> updating input where it is reading and writing 
why do I need a state variable? updating local variable will not trigger rerender, where state variable will trigger rerender 
react destroys current component & create a new one
