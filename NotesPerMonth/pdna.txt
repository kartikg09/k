how to understand aggregation in postgres?
aggregation means joining multiple rows on the basic of the condition.
For example
I want to join total leave, dates, and reasons for all employees?
Table Name - employees_leaves_data
Table Column id, code, leave_dates, reason
Soln - 
if I club leave_dates, count of leave_dates and reason with code. Do this for all employees.
For implementing above use below query - 
select e.code, array_agg(leave_dates), count(leave_dates), array_agg(reason) from employees_leaves_data e group_by e.code;
The above query grouping the data on the basis of employee code and the aggregation functions like array_agg, count to perform the task.
array_agg club the data from various rows in one row, and count will yeild the total rows which are clubbed together.

React common component rendering Behaviour on navigation like header menu?
The react has ability to cache current page components. So when navigation is done in react it will render the component. 
But will not re render thus any change in state while navigation on to another page will not picked up by state. 
So if using useEffect with empty dependency array will work? 
No, still it will not pick the change written inside useeffect while navigation if we pass a empty dependency array.
As, it is rendering the same component which is cached and do not watch state, as no change in dependency array thus on navigation no change will be visible.
So, always pass the dynamic paths in the dependency array to rerender the component and do the desirable changes. Use useLocation hook in react-route-dom to do that.

Priority of classes while adding them in class option
class="mx-auto p-auto bg-green"
order - mx-auto < p-auto < bg-green (Check again)

Designed 1st header after 2 years through imagination not reference or copying
Used background color - as shown in most of the website
Used mx-auto container - to containerize the header with margin auto (used bg color in parent div to cover the entire heading in webpage)
Used flex and its property justify-center inside the header 
flex properties on child divs but not on any of their childs thus can be used with grouping
used margin auto and padding for spacing

Apache Kafka - A distributed streaming platform
Stream - infinite data, data that never ends. It just keeping arriving, and you can process it in real-time.
Distributed means that Kafka works in a cluster, each node in the cluster is called Broker. Those brokers are just servers executing a copy of apache Kafka.
Kafka is a set of machines working together to be able to handle and process real-time infinite data.

Pros:
The distributed architecture is one of the reasons that made Kafka so popular. The Brokers is what makes it so resilient, reliable, scalable, and fault-tolerant. That's why Kafka is so performer and secure.

Messaging works:
Producer: Who Produces and send the messages to one or more queues.
Queue: A buffer data structure, that receives (from the producers) and delivers messages (to the customers) in a FIFO (First-In First-Out) way. When a message is delivered, it's removed forever from the queue, there's no chance to get it back.
Consumer: Who is subscribed to one or more queues and receives their messages when published.

Kafka architecture
Producer --> Cluster --> Consumer
Cluster contain's nodes(Broker)
In this we do not have Queue concept, we have Topics.
The Topic is a very specific type of data stream, it's very similar to a Queue, it receives and delivers messages as well.
