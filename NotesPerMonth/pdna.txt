how to understand aggregation in postgres?
aggregation means joining multiple rows on the basic of the condition.
For example
I want to join total leave, dates, and reasons for all employees?
Table Name - employees_leaves_data
Table Column id, code, leave_dates, reason
Soln - 
if I club leave_dates, count of leave_dates and reason with code. Do this for all employees.
For implementing above use below query - 
select e.code, array_agg(leave_dates), count(leave_dates), array_agg(reason) from employees_leaves_data e group_by e.code;
The above query grouping the data on the basis of employee code and the aggregation functions like array_agg, count to perform the task.
array_agg club the data from various rows in one row, and count will yeild the total rows which are clubbed together.

React common component rendering Behaviour on navigation like header menu?
The react has ability to cache current page components. So when navigation is done in react it will render the component. 
But will not re render thus any change in state while navigation on to another page will not picked up by state. 
So if using useEffect with empty dependency array will work? 
No, still it will not pick the change written inside useeffect while navigation if we pass a empty dependency array.
As, it is rendering the same component which is cached and do not watch state, as no change in dependency array thus on navigation no change will be visible.
So, always pass the dynamic paths in the dependency array to rerender the component and do the desirable changes. Use useLocation hook in react-route-dom to do that.
