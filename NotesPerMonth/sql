Transaction query?
Group a set of tasks into a single execution unit. Each transactions begins with a specific job and ends when all the tasks in the group successfully completed. If any of the tasks fails, the transaction fails.
A database transaction, by defination, must be atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable. (ACID) to ensure concurrent execution of multiple transactions without conflict.
ACID:
Atomicity: The outcome of a transaction can either be completely successful or completely unsuccessful. The whole transaction must be rolled back if one part of it fails.
Consistency: Transaction maintain integrity restrictions by moving the database from one valid state to another.
Isolation: Concurrent transations are isolated from one another, assuring the accuracy of the data.
Durability: Once a transaction is committed, its modifications remain in effect even in the event of a system failure.

Transaction control commands are only used with the DML Commands such as - INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE.

-> SQL statements are grouped together using transactions.
-> They promise that either all changes are made or none at all.
-> Reliability is ensured by the ACID qualities.
-> Start a transaction with "BEGIN TRANSACTION", and finish it with "COMMIT" or "ROLLBACK" to complete or undo changes. 
-> SAVEPOINT to rollback to certain point

TRUNCATE TABLE
truncating/emptying the table.
It have 4 options
continue identity - default it doesn't modify or restart the value of orders.
restart identity - reset the identity column.
cascade - truncate all the including those tables that have foreign key references to other tables.
restrict - default to decline truncate of the table that have foreign key references to other tables.
