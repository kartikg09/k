Redux - A predictable state container for JS apps.
Predictable - Redux helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to test.
Centralized - Centralized your application's state and logic enables powerful capabilities like undo/redo, state persistance, and much more.
Debuggable - The redux devtools make it easy to trace when, where, why, and how your application's state changed. Redux architecture lets you log changes, use "time-travel debugging", and even send complete error reports to server.
Flexible - Redux works with any ui layer, and has a large ecosystem of addons to fix your needs.
