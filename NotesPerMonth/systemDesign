Function requirement - what should our system do
Non Functional requirement - not written but required to fulfill
Paypal system design
Availability, Scalability, Performance, Data Integrity,
Simplicity, Flexibility, Manageability, and Maintainability

Payment gateway system design 
Functional requirement:
-> Allows multiple ways of payments.
-> Secure Payment details.
-> Secure transactions
-> Avoid Double Payment
-> Fast Response
-> Handle Timeout and failure

Non Functional Requirements
-> Highly Consistent
-> Highly available
-> Scalable
-> Performance

###### High level design ######
-> System architecture
-> Database design
-> Brief description of systems, services, platforms, and relationships among modules.
It Consist Flows:
1. Data Flows
2. Flowcharts
3. Data Structures

Explaining the connection between system components and operations which depict the logic, &
Architecture design needed (for the system's functionality and flow) for each and every module of the system.

HLD doesnot include physical requirement, port details, VLAN, and many other details.

HLD terms:
1. Capacity Estimation
2. HTTP method
3. Web sockets
4. Pooling
5. Server-Sent Events
6. Filtering and Logging
7. Rate Limiting
8. Resiliency
9. Paging and Filtering
10. Logging
Roadmap of the system are based of HLD
Capacity Estimation
Characteristics behaviour of a server (like concurrency) which is measured across throughput and latency within the system.
Concurrency - 
Throughput - 
Latency - 

HTTP Method:
GET, POST, PUT
2 ways to send data from server to client:
Using Websockets, Using pooling

Web sockets:
real time communication
cannot let our system wait for response
Example: text messaging service, stock price system, food and grocery delivery systems.

Pooling:
Long pooling and short pooling
Long pooling wait for the server to send the response
Short pooling immediately send the data at fixed intervals.

Server Sent Events:
Purposely built as one-way communication from servers to clients in specific design systems. Example-> Realtime streaming.

Filtering:
The control room api supports filtering, pagination, and sorting for endpoints that return arrays of resources.

Rate Limiting
Restrict the number of events that can be done in a timeframe by restricting the number of requests a sender can send in a given period of time.

Resiliency
Avoid fault and failure tolerance by
Replication, Redundancy, Availability

Paging

Logging

###### Low Level Design ######

##### System Design #####
Systematic process involving phases
Planning, analysis, designing, deploying, and testing.

System Analysis: Process of collecting requirements(functional and non-functional) so as to prose out any business design logic.
long & simple process, lesser time
System Design: Process of portraying down business logic for new ones or updating the existing ones.
short & complex process, more time

### Relational Dbms ### (Confused)

1. They are excellent at keeping data transactions secure.
2. They provide the ability to write complex SQL queries for data analysis and reporting.
3. Their models can ensure and enfore business rules at the data layer adding a level of data integrity not found in a non-relational database.
